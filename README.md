# Description
This webpage was made to showcase my portfolio of web projects to possible employers.  It has an about me section, a collection of images with links to my work, and a contact me section with my phone number and important links.

# Usage
The user can navigate to sections of the webpage by clicking the links in the top right corner of the webpage.  The About Me section is a brief summery of who I am and what I want to acomplish.  The My Work section has clickable images that link to projects that I have worked on.  The Contact Me section has my phone number and links to my email and Github.
